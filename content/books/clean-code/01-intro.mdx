# Introduction

Clean code is not just about code that works. It is about code that can be read, understood, and maintained by humans.

## Why Clean Code Matters

> "Even bad code can function. But if code isn't clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees."

### The Boy Scout Rule

Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it.
