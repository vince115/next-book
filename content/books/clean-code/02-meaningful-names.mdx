# Meaningful Names

Names are everywhere in software. We name our variables, our functions, our arguments, our classes, and our packages.

## Use Intention-Revealing Names

The name of a variable, function, or class, should answer all the big questions. It should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used.

```typescript
// Bad
let d: number; // elapsed time in days

// Good
let elapsedTimeInDays: number;
let daysSinceCreation: number;
```
